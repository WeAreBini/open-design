// InlineModelSwitcher — top-bar chip exposing CLI/BYOK + model picker.
//
// Lives in the entry view's sticky top-bar so users can swap between a
// local CLI and BYOK (and the active model under either) without having
// to open the full Settings dialog. The chip is intentionally narrow —
// it shows the active mode + agent/provider + model in one line and
// opens a compact popover for switching. All persistence is delegated
// upward through the same callbacks `AvatarMenu` already uses, so the
// switcher inherits autosave + daemon sync without re-implementing it.
